### Excel Solver for Market Demand Allocation
This folder contains an Excel Solver model and a managerial report. The project involves optimizing the allocation of production units across TelecomOne's manufacturing plants to minimize costs while meeting market demands.

**Project Description:** TelecomOne operates manufacturing plants in Baltimore, Memphis, Wichita, Wyoming, and Salt Lake City, serving markets in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Omaha, and Portland. The pre-provided data includes production, inventory, and transportation costs, plant capacities, fixed monthly costs, and monthly demand.

**Optimization Model:** The optimization model employs decision variables (Xi and Yij) and an objective function to minimize the total cost. Various constraints, such as capacity, demand, and binary constraints, are applied.

**Usage:** The Excel Solver is used to find the optimal solution. You can also adjust data to explore different scenarios.
